# Midterm Cheatsheet

### Even/odd functions

Even: $f(x) = f(-x)$, like $x^2$ (reflected about $y$-axis)

Odd: $-f(x) = f(-x)$, like $x^3$ (rotational symmetry about origin)

### Limits of rational functions

If $\lim\limits_{x\to a} \f{f(x)}{g(x)}$ exists and equals $L$,
and $\lim\limits_{x\to a} g(x) = 0$, then we must have

$$
\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x) = 0
$$

because

$$
\begin{align}
\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)
  &= \lim\limits_{x\to a} \f{f(x)}{g(x)} \cdot \lim\limits_{x\to a}g(x)
\\&= L \cdot 0
\\&= 0
\end{align}
$$

### Types of discontinuities

- jump
- infinite
- removable
- endpoint
- mixed

### Limit of composites

If $f$ and $g$ are functions such that $\lim\limits_{x\to a} g(x) =
b$, and $f(x)$ is continuous at $b$, then

$$
\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(g(x))
= f\lr{ \lim\limits_{x\to a} g(x) }
= f(b)
$$

### Fermat's Theorem

If $g$ has a local extreme at $c$, then we must have $g'(c) = 0$.

### Precise definitions

#### $\epsilon,\delta$ definition of limit

Suppose $\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x) = L$.

Then for every real $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a real $\delta > 0$
such that for all real $x$,

$$
0 < |x−a| < \delta \implies |f(x)−L| < \epsilon.
$$

#### Definition of divergent limit

Suppose $\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x) = \infty$.

Then for every $M\in\R^+$, there exists a real $\delta > 0$ such that
for all real $x$,

$$
0 < \abs{x-a} < \delta \implies f(x) > M
$$

#### Definition of limit approaching infinity

Suppose $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} f(x) = L$.

then for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N ∈ \R$ such that

$$
x > N \implies \abs{f(x) - L} < \epsilon
$$

#### Both go to infinity

Suppose $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} f(x) = \infty$.

Then for every $M ∈ \R^+$, there exists $N ∈ \R^+$ such that

$$
x > N \implies f(x) > M
$$

### Differentiability

$f$ is differentiable at $a$ if and only if

$$
f'(a) = \lim\limits_{x\to a} \f{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}
$$

exists.

### Continuity

$f$ is continuous at a if $f(a)$ exists and

$$
\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)
$$

exists. That is, $\lim\limits_{x\to a^-} f(x) = \lim\limits_{x\to a^+} f(x)$

### Binomial expansion

For all positive integers $n$,

$$
\begin{align}
a^n - b^n = (a - b)(
a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \ldots + b^{n-1}
    )
\end{align}
$$

and for all odd integers $n$,

$$
\begin{align}
a^n + b^n = (a + b)(
a^{n-1} - a^{n-2}b + \ldots + b^{n-1}
    )
\end{align}
$$

Note that since $a - b = \lr{a^\tf{1}{n}}^n - \lr{b^\tf{1}{n}}^n$,

$$
a - b = \lr{a^\tf{1}{n} - b^\tf{1}{n}}
\lr{
a^\tf{n-1}{n} - a^\tf{n-2}{n}b^\tf{1}{n} + \ldots + b^\tf{n-1}{n}
}
$$

### Rolle's Theorem

Suppose $f$ is a function which is continuous on $[a,b]$.

If $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists a number $c \in (a,b)$ such that
$f'(c) = 0$.

#### Mean value theorem

Suppose $f$ is a function which is continuous on $[a,b]$.

Then there exists a number $c \in [a,b]$ such that

$$
f'(c) = \f{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$

### Showing at most $n$ roots

Assume that $f(x) = x^4 - 4x + 1$ has **three** real roots $x_1 < x_2 <
x_3$. Then $f(x_1) = f(x_2) = f(x_3) = 0$.

By [Rolle's Theorem](#rolle's-theorem), there exist $d_1\in(x_1, x_2)$
and $d_2\in(x_2, x_3)$ such that $f'(d_1) = f'(d_2) = 0$

However, $f'(x) = 4x^3 - 4$. We would have $d_2 = d_1 = 1$, a
contradiction. So $f(x) = 0$ has at most **two** real roots.

#### Special case: showing at most 1 root

If it's known that $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f$ is one-to-one
and immediately has at most one root.

### Intermediate Value Theorem

Suppose $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.

Then there exists $c \in [a,b]$ such that $f(c) \in (f(a),f(b))$.

### Mean Value Theorem

Suppose $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.

Then there exists $c \in [a,b]$ such that
$f(c) = \f{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$.

### Showing at least $n$ roots

For every root, use Intermediate Value Theorem on both sides.

### Proving Limits

Think blunt. We only need to find a $\delta$ in terms of $\epsilon$
such that given $0 < \abs{x-a} < \delta$, $\abs{f(x) - L} < \epsilon$
is guaranteed.

### Justifying maximum/minimum:

Identify the interval
compare the interval bounds + critical points

###

Reverse chain rule for integration

$$
\inti{[f(x)]^n f'(x)}{x} = \f{1}{n+1} [f(x)]^{n+1} + c
,\ n\neq -1
$$

and when $n = -1$,

$$
\inti{\f{f'(x)}{f(x)}}{x} = \ln|f(x)| + c
$$

trigonometric integrations
hyperbolic trigo functions

$$
\f{\d}{\d x} a^{f(x)} = a^x \ln a \cdot f'(x)
$$

inflection point: a point where curvature **changes sign**.

### converting infinite sums to definite integrals

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i = 1}^n f(i, n)
$$

force it into this form:

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i = 1}^n F \lr{\f{i}{n}} \cdot \f{1}{n}
$$

then you can safely convert it directly to

$$
\intd{0}{1}{F(x)}{x}
$$

{/* TODO: add a brief explanation for the internet */}

### change base

Let $\displaystyle\inti{f(x)}{x} = g(x)$. It follows that $\f{\d}{\d x} g(x) = f(x)$. Then

$$
\f{\d}{\d u}\intd{0}{u}{f(t)}{t} = f(u)
$$

Because

$$
\begin{align}
\f{\d}{\d u}\intd{0}{u}{f(t)}{t}
&= \f{\d}{\d u}\Lr{g(u) - g(0)} \\
&= \f{\d}{\d u}\Lr{g(u)} \\
&= f(u)
\end{align}
$$

Extending with chain rule,

$$
\f{\d}{\d u}\intd{0}{h(u)}{f(t)}{t} = f(h(u))\cdot h'(u)
$$

Because

$$
\begin{align}
\f{\d}{\d u}\intd{0}{h(u)}{f(t)}{t}
&= \f{\d}{\d u}\Lr{g(h(u)) - g(0)} \\
&= \f{\d}{\d u}\Lr{g(h(u))} \\
&= f(h(u)) \cdot h'(u)
\end{align}
$$

### partial fractions

get good at it so you can separate fractions in integrals

1. make it a proper rational expression
2. factor the denominator

Then there are cases where you need to add more constants. This
example should cover those:

$$
\f{1}{(x-2)^3(x^2 + 1)}
= \f{A}{x-2}
+ \f{B}{(x-2)^2}
+ \f{C}{(x-2)^3}
+ \f{Dx + E}{x^2 + 4}
$$

Reason for $A$, $B$, and $C$: $(x-2)^3$ has a degree of 3 so at each
level you have to assign a constant to catch possible coefficients.

Reason for $Dx + E$: $(x^2+4)$ is of degree 2 so you need to make it
one degree less to be flexible enough to catch all solutions.

### Derivatives as limits

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{x\to a} \f{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}
$$

### Finding min/max points

Simplify the equation first. If asked to find the min/max points of 

$$
\f{1}{4(2-\sin t)\sqrt{2(2+\sin t)}}
$$

Then clearly it suffices to find the min/max of

$$
(2-\sin t)^2 (2+\sin t)
$$

This removes a lot of fluff since we just need to find the zeros.

### Core integration identities

Taking rotation about the $x$-axis:

#### Shell Method (Volume)

$$
V_x = \pi \inti{y^2}{x}
$$

#### Disc Method (Volume)

$$
V_x = 2\pi \inti{xy}{y}
$$

#### Arc Length

$$
L = \inti{\sqrt{1 + \lr{\dd{y}{x}}^2  }}{x}
$$

#### Surface Area

$$
\begin{align}
S_x &= 2\pi \inti{y \sqrt{1 + \lr{\dd{y}{x}}^2  }}{x} \\
    &= 2\pi \inti{y \sqrt{1 + \lr{\dd{x}{y}}^2  }}{y}
\end{align}
$$
